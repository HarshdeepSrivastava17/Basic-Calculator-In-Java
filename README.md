# Basic-Calculator-In-Java
This project is a Basic Calculator built as part of a CodeChef programming task. The calculator performs fundamental arithmetic operations using Java and demonstrates core programming concepts like functions, loops, user input handling, and conditional statements.
🚀 Features

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

🔁 Continuous operations using loop

❌ Exit option using break statement

🖥️ Console-based interactive interface

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

Scanner class for user input

While loop for repeated operations

🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:

Practice Java fundamentals

Understand function implementation

Learn loop control using break

Simulate a real-world calculator logic

📌 How It Works
